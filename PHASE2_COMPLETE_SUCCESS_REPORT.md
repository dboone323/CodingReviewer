## Feature Capabilities Now Available

### 1. **Smart File Analysis**
```swift
// Automatic language detection
let language = detectLanguage(for: fileURL)

// Language-specific analysis
let analysis = performLanguageSpecificAnalysis(content, language: language)

// Project-level insights
let insights = generateProjectInsights(for: projectFiles)
```

### 2. **Advanced Search & Filtering**
```swift
// Search with multiple criteria
let results = searchFiles(query: "function", language: .swift, includeContent: true)

// Filter by language, size, date
let filtered = filterFiles(by: criteria)
```

### 3. **Quality Analysis**
```swift
// Comprehensive code quality assessment
let quality = analyzeCodeQuality(for: code, language: language)

// AI-powered suggestions (simplified interface)
let suggestions = performComprehensiveAnalysis(for: file)
```
