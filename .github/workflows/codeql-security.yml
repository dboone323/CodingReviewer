        ### Analysis Configuration
        - **Queries**: Security and Quality + Experimental
        - **Platform**: macOS
        - **Build Tool**: Xcode
        
        ### Results
        Security findings will be available in the [Security tab](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/security/code-scanning).
        
        ### Next Steps
        1. Review any security alerts in the Security tab
        2. Address high-priority vulnerabilities immediately
        3. Update dependencies if security issues are found
        4. Monitor for new security advisories
