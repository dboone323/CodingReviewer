    private let service: ServiceProtocol
    
    init(service: ServiceProtocol) {
        self.service = service
    }
    
    @MainActor
    func performAction() async {
        state = .loading
        do {
            let result = try await service.fetchData()
            state = .success(result)
        } catch {
            state = .error(error)
        }
    }
}
```
