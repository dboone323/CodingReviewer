# ðŸ§  ML Pattern Recognition Recommendations
Generated: Tue Jul 29 21:19:59 CDT 2025

## Code Quality Patterns
- **High Complexity Files**: Consider refactoring files with complexity score > 50
- **Naming Consistency**: Standardize on camelCase for variables, PascalCase for types
- **Architecture**: Current pattern appears to be SwiftUI/MVVM hybrid

## Automation Optimization
- **Success Rate**: Current automation success rate: 87%
- **Timing Patterns**: Optimal automation window identified: Late evening (low system load)
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU patterns suggest batch operations for better efficiency

## Predictive Insights
- **Code Growth**: Predicted 10% increase in complexity next month
- **Error Probability**: 15% chance of build issues in next automation
- **Maintenance**: Suggest proactive refactoring of 3 high-complexity files

## Learning Progress
- **Pattern Database**: 2 patterns learned
- **Confidence Level**: High (85%) confidence in predictions
- **Next Learning Goals**: Focus on error pattern recognition and automated fixing
