- **Automation Scripts**:        1 provisioning scripts
- **Environment Configs**: Development, Staging, Production
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration with custom alarms

## 🚀 Deployment Pipeline Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow integration
name: Advanced CI/CD Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  risk-assessment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Assess Deployment Risk
        run: ./advanced_cicd_enhancer.sh --assess-risk
      
  performance-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Detect Performance Regression
        run: ./advanced_cicd_enhancer.sh --performance-check
      
  canary-deploy:
    needs: [risk-assessment, performance-check]
    if: needs.risk-assessment.outputs.strategy == 'canary'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy Canary
        run: ./canary_deploy.sh deploy ${{ github.sha }}
```

## 📊 System Health Metrics
**Overall CI/CD Health Score**: 100/100

## 🔧 Generated Components Summary
- **Risk Assessment**: ML-enhanced deployment strategy selection
- **Canary Deployment**: Automated gradual rollout with monitoring
- **Performance Detection**: ML-based regression analysis
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform-based environment provisioning
- **Monitoring**: Real-time dashboards and alerting

## 💡 Best Practices Implemented
1. **Shift-Left Security**: Early risk assessment in pipeline
2. **Progressive Delivery**: Canary and blue-green deployment strategies
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time performance and health tracking
4. **Infrastructure as Code**: Version-controlled infrastructure
5. **Automated Recovery**: Self-healing deployments with rollback

## 📝 Recommendations
1. **Integrate with monitoring systems** (DataDog, New Relic, Prometheus)
2. **Configure notification channels** (Slack, PagerDuty, email)
3. **Set up environment-specific thresholds** for risk assessment
4. **Implement security scanning** in the deployment pipeline
5. **Add custom metrics** for application-specific monitoring
