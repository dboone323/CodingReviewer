# System Design Documentation

## Design Principles

### 1. Modularity
- Each AI system is independently deployable
- Clear interfaces between components
- Minimal coupling, high cohesion

### 2. Observability
- Comprehensive logging at all levels
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Health checks for all components

### 3. Reliability
- Graceful error handling and recovery
- Circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies
- Automated testing and validation

### 4. Scalability
- Asynchronous processing where possible
- Resource-efficient algorithms
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
