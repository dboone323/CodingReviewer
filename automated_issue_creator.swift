                ## Issue Description
                SwiftLint has detected force unwrapping violations that need to be addressed.
                
                ## Impact
                - Security risk: Force unwrapping can cause crashes
                - Code quality degradation
                - User experience impact
                
                ## Automated Analysis
                Based on the latest SwiftLint scan, the following files contain force unwrapping:
                
                ## Recommended Actions
                1. Replace force unwrapping with optional binding
                2. Add appropriate error handling
                3. Update tests to cover error cases

                ## Test Coverage Analysis
                
                Current test coverage analysis indicates areas needing improvement.
                
                ## Identified Gaps
                - Core analysis components
                - AI service integration
                - Error handling paths
                
                ## MCP-Powered Recommendations
                1. Add unit tests for critical paths
                2. Implement integration tests for AI services
                3. Add UI tests for user workflows
                
                ## Automation Opportunities
                - Automated test generation for new features
                - Coverage tracking in CI/CD pipeline
