## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: [security contact needed]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Provide steps to reproduce if possible

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolution
- **Resolution Timeline**: 30 days for critical issues

### Security Measures

Our project implements multiple security layers:

- ✅ **Automated Security Scanning** - CodeQL analysis
- ✅ **Dependency Monitoring** - Dependabot alerts
- ✅ **Vulnerability Management** - Regular security updates
- ✅ **Code Review Process** - Security-focused reviews
- ✅ **CI/CD Security** - Automated security checks

## Security Features
