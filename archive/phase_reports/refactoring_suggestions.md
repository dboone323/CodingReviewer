## Refactoring Strategy:
1. **Extract Extensions**: Move extensions to separate files
2. **Separate Protocols**: Move protocol definitions to dedicated files  
3. **Utility Functions**: Create shared utility modules
4. **View Components**: Split large views into smaller components
5. **Service Layers**: Separate service implementations
