### Feature Flag Framework
```swift
enum FeatureFlag: String, CaseIterable {
    case newCodeAnalysisEngine = "new_code_analysis_engine"
    case advancedPatternRecognition = "advanced_pattern_recognition"
    case realTimeCollaboration = "real_time_collaboration"
    case aiPoweredSuggestions = "ai_powered_suggestions"
    case betaDashboard = "beta_dashboard"
}
```

## 🔄 Automated Rollback System

### Trigger Thresholds
- **Error Rate Spike**: >5% for 5+ minutes
- **Performance Degradation**: >20% for 10+ minutes
- **Crash Rate Increase**: >2% for 3+ minutes
- **Manual Trigger**: Team-initiated emergency rollback

### Rollback Strategies
1. **Feature Flag Disable** (Priority 1, Immediate)
2. **Previous Version Deploy** (Priority 2, 5-10 minutes)
3. **Database Rollback** (Priority 3, 10-30 minutes)
