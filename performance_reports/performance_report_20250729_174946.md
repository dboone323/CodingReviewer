**Generated:** Tue Jul 29 17:49:51 CDT 2025  
**Project:** CodingReviewer  
**Analysis Duration:** Performance monitoring session

## 📊 Build Performance

- **Build Duration:** 4 seconds
- **Build Status:** ✅ Successful

### Build Performance Rating
🟢 **Excellent** - Build time under 30 seconds

## 💾 Memory Analysis

- **Total System Memory:** 16GB
- **Available Memory:** 237 MB
- **Memory Status:** ⚠️ Limited

## 🖥️ CPU Analysis

- **CPU:** Apple M1 Pro
- **CPU Cores:** 10
- **Current Usage:** 23.45%

## 📁 Project Metrics

- **Swift Files:** 48
- **Total Lines:** 13042
- **Project Size:** 528K
- **Avg Lines/File:** 271

### Code Complexity Assessment
🟡 **Medium Complexity** - Consider refactoring larger files

## 🎯 Performance Recommendations

- 💾 Low available memory (237MB) - may impact build performance

## 📈 Optimization Opportunities

### Immediate Actions (Low Effort, High Impact)
- Enable build parallelization in Xcode settings
- Use incremental builds during development
- Optimize import statements

### Medium-term Improvements (Medium Effort, High Impact)
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Add performance tracking to critical paths
- Optimize image and asset loading

### Long-term Strategy (High Effort, High Impact)
- Consider modular architecture for large codebases
- Implement caching strategies for expensive operations
- Profile and optimize hot code paths

## 🔧 Performance Monitoring Setup

The PerformanceTracker.swift file has been created to enable ongoing performance monitoring:

```swift
// Start tracking an operation
PerformanceTracker.shared.startTracking("file_analysis")

// Your code here...

// End tracking
PerformanceTracker.shared.endTracking("file_analysis")
```

## 📊 Next Steps

1. **Integrate Performance Tracking:** Add PerformanceTracker calls to critical code paths
2. **Monitor Build Times:** Track build performance over time
3. **Profile Memory Usage:** Use Instruments to identify memory bottlenecks
4. **Optimize Hot Paths:** Focus on frequently executed code
5. **Regular Monitoring:** Run this script weekly to track improvements
